## Introduction
The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world. In this visualization project, we have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on IPL 2008-2019 dataset by exploring through various statistical tools that might interest cricket entusiasts. 

### Problem Statement:
To form a dream cricket team by analysing IPL ball-by-ball and match by match dataset. Players who have played/ bowled 300 balls are not considered.


### Methodology

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Using descriptive statistics to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.

- BestWorst Method- Best-Worst Method (BWM) is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method where a number of alternatives have to be evaluated with respect to a number of criterias. 

### Our proposed ideal Super 11: 
## "Chennai TITANS"
It comprises of strong openers, middle-order hitters, all-rounders, a reliable wicketkeeper, and a collection of quick and spin bowlers.

## Dataset 

**Source**: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020>

This dataset consists of two seperate CSV files : matches and deliveries. These files contain the information of each match summary and ball by ball details, respectively

```{r}
dataframe1 <- read.csv("IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv")
dataframe2 <- read.csv("IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv")

dataframe01 <- read.csv("IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv")
dataframe02 <- read.csv("IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv")


```

## Assumptions
- Home ground: Chennai
- Total matches played 16 matches  
- Winning points per matches 2 points
- Minimum points for qualification is 16 points
- Out of 16 matches, 8 matches are played in home in order to increase the probability of playoffs and finals. The core team will be based on home ground
- Players have not subjected to  any kinds of injuries  during IPL tenure
- None of the players given in the data are retired  IPL is conducted in India,  not in any neutral venue
- None of the players are retired 

## Pitch Conditions
- The MA Chidambaram Stadium, has been in operation since  1916, making it India’s oldest existing stadium

- Opened: 1916
- Capacity: 50,000
- Known as: Chepauk; Madras Cricket Club Ground  
- Ends – Anna Pavilion End, V Pattabhiraman Gate  
- Location – Chennai, India
- Home to – Tamil Nadu, Chennai Super Kings

- Traditionally, the wicket at this venue suits the spinners and  since overseas batsmen generally struggle against spin,  India have dominated their opponents
The weather is expected to be sunny. The temperature will  stay around 25-30 degrees Celsius, and no rain interruptions  are expected
- When the  pitches were uncovered and left unattended to, it aided the fast  bowlers in the past, Now the wickets have become spin-friendly
- What stands out at Chepauk is the atmosphere and crowd, which are  said to be the most knowledgeable and appreciative in the country  smostly presented before an audience.


## Descriptive Statistics

#Best worst method

Steps: 
- Determine a set of decision criteria. 
- Determine the best (e.g. the most important), and the worst (e.g.
the least important) criteria
- Determine the preference of the best criterion over all the other
criteria using a number between 1 and 9 (or other scales). 
- Determine the preference of all the criteria over the worst criterion
using a number between 1 and 9 (or other scales).
- Find the optimal weights
-To find the optimal weights, the following optimization model is formulated.

- Across IPL, V Kohli has scored the highest number of runs followed by S Raina and David Warner.  
- It can be observed that batsmen from top 3 order dominate the list. AB de Villiers and MS Dhoni are the only middle order batsmen in the top 10 run getters list.

- Having faced a minimum of 300 balls, AD Russell has the highest strike rate of around 175, followed by N Pooran and S Narine. Interestingly all the top 3 are West Indians

- It can be observed that most of them are middle – order batsmen except V Sehwag and JC Butler who are openers

```

- Among Bowlers, SL Malinga has bagged the highest number of wickets followed by DJ Bravo and A Mishra. 

- There is a balance between the pacers and spinners in the top 10 wicket takers.

- Also, 7 out of 10 bowlers are Indians

- Lowest economy rate is observed for spinners with Rashid Khan having the lowest.

- Among bowlers with more than 150 wickets, R Ashwin has the lowest economy rate followed closely by SP Narine, Harbhajan Singh and SL Malinga

- Interesting observation: DJ Bravo has high economy rate in spite of being in top 3 highest wicket takers which maybe due to him bowling in the death overs majority of times.

```
- Most of the stumpings in IPL have been done by MS Dhoni

- MS Dhoni has most of the Man of the match player among wicket keeper batsman category 

- MS Dhoni is also top 10 run-getter of all time

## Captaincy Selection

  ylab("Win Percentage") +  guides(fill=FALSE)+coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100))
```

- Rising Pune Supergiants and Chennai Super Kings have the highest win percentage among all the teams. Both the teams have been captained by MS Dhoni. 
- Also, he has led Chennai Super Kings to win the IPL title thrice and also captained Rising Pune Supergiant once in overall 2 years of  their IPL stint.
